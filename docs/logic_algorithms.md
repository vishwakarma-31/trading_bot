# Logic and Algorithms Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed documentation of the core algorithms and logic used in the GoQuant Trading Bot, including arbitrage detection, CBBO calculation, venue signaling, and data processing mechanisms.

## 1. Arbitrage Detection Algorithm

### 1.1 Step-by-Step Explanation

The arbitrage detection algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Fetch L1 market data (best bid/ask prices) for a specific symbol from all specified exchanges
2. **Data Validation**: Validate that all required data fields are present and valid
3. **Cross-Exchange Comparison**: Compare ask prices (buy prices) and bid prices (sell prices) across all exchange pairs
4. **Profit Calculation**: Calculate potential profit percentage and absolute value for each exchange pair
5. **Threshold Comparison**: Check if calculated profits meet user-configured minimum thresholds
6. **Opportunity Recording**: Record valid arbitrage opportunities that meet all criteria

### 1.2 Formula for Spread Calculation

The algorithm uses the following formulas to calculate arbitrage profits:

**Absolute Profit Formula**:
```
Absolute Profit = Sell Price - Buy Price
```

Where:
- Sell Price = Best bid price on selling exchange
- Buy Price = Best ask price on buying exchange

**Percentage Profit Formula**:
```
Percentage Profit = ((Sell Price - Buy Price) / Buy Price) × 100
```

### 1.3 Threshold Comparison Logic

The algorithm compares calculated profits against two configurable thresholds:

1. **Percentage Threshold**: Minimum required profit percentage
2. **Absolute Threshold**: Minimum required profit in absolute currency value

Both conditions must be met for an opportunity to be considered valid:
```
IF (Percentage Profit ≥ Min Percentage Threshold) AND 
   (Absolute Profit ≥ Min Absolute Threshold)
THEN Valid Arbitrage Opportunity
```

### 1.4 Example Calculations

Let's consider an example with BTC-USDT on two exchanges:

**Exchange A (Binance)**:
- Best Ask Price: $60,000.00
- Best Bid Price: $59,999.50

**Exchange B (OKX)**:
- Best Ask Price: $59,950.00
- Best Bid Price: $59,949.00

**Arbitrage Opportunity Calculation**:
1. Buy on Exchange B at $59,950.00 (ask price)
2. Sell on Exchange A at $59,999.50 (bid price)
3. Absolute Profit = $59,999.50 - $59,950.00 = $49.50
4. Percentage Profit = (($59,999.50 - $59,950.00) / $59,950.00) × 100 = 0.0826%

If the user's thresholds are:
- Minimum Percentage: 0.05%
- Minimum Absolute: $10.00

Then this would be a valid arbitrage opportunity since:
- 0.0826% ≥ 0.05% (✓)
- $49.50 ≥ $10.00 (✓)

## 2. CBBO Calculation Algorithm

### 2.1 How Best Bid is Determined Across Exchanges

The Consolidated Best Bid (CBBO) calculation algorithm determines the best bid price across all monitored exchanges by:

1. **Data Collection**: Fetch L1 market data from all specified exchanges
2. **Bid Price Extraction**: Extract the bid price from each exchange's market data
3. **Maximum Selection**: Select the highest bid price among all exchanges
4. **Exchange Identification**: Record which exchange has the best bid price

**Algorithm**:
```
FOR each exchange in monitored_exchanges:
    bid_price = get_bid_price(exchange, symbol)
    IF bid_price > best_bid_price:
        best_bid_price = bid_price
        best_bid_exchange = exchange
```

### 2.2 How Best Offer is Determined Across Exchanges

The Consolidated Best Ask (CBBO) calculation algorithm determines the best ask price across all monitored exchanges by:

1. **Data Collection**: Fetch L1 market data from all specified exchanges
2. **Ask Price Extraction**: Extract the ask price from each exchange's market data
3. **Minimum Selection**: Select the lowest ask price among all exchanges (greater than zero)
4. **Exchange Identification**: Record which exchange has the best ask price

**Algorithm**:
```
FOR each exchange in monitored_exchanges:
    ask_price = get_ask_price(exchange, symbol)
    IF (ask_price > 0) AND (ask_price < best_ask_price):
        best_ask_price = ask_price
        best_ask_exchange = exchange
```

### 2.3 Mid-Price Calculation Formula

The mid-price is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the best bid and best ask prices:

```
Mid-Price = (Best Bid Price + Best Ask Price) / 2
```

### 2.4 Example Calculations

Let's consider BTC-USDT prices across four exchanges:

**Binance**:
- Bid: $60,000.50
- Ask: $60,001.00

**OKX**:
- Bid: $60,000.00
- Ask: $60,000.50

**Bybit**:
- Bid: $60,001.00
- Ask: $60,001.50

**Deribit**:
- Bid: $59,999.50
- Ask: $60,000.00

**CBBO Calculation**:
1. Best Bid = $60,001.00 (Bybit)
2. Best Ask = $60,000.00 (Deribit)
3. Mid-Price = ($60,001.00 + $60,000.00) / 2 = $60,000.50

## 3. Venue Signaling Logic

### 3.1 How Best Venues are Identified

Venue signaling identifies the best venues for trading by:

1. **CBBO Calculation**: Determine the best bid and ask prices across all exchanges
2. **Exchange Mapping**: Record which exchanges have the best prices
3. **Venue Ranking**: Create a ranking of exchanges based on price competitiveness
4. **Signal Generation**: Generate signals indicating the best venues for buying and selling

### 3.2 When Updates are Triggered

Venue signaling updates are triggered by:

1. **Periodic Updates**: Regular intervals based on user configuration (default: 30 seconds)
2. **Significant Changes**: When price movements exceed user-defined thresholds
3. **New Data Arrival**: When fresh market data is received via WebSocket
4. **Manual Requests**: When users explicitly request CBBO information

### 3.3 Significant Change Detection Logic

Significant changes are detected using percentage-based thresholds:

```
Price Change Percentage = |(New Price - Old Price) / Old Price| × 100

IF Price Change Percentage ≥ Significant Change Threshold
THEN Trigger Update
```

For example, if the significant change threshold is 0.1% and the best bid price changes from $60,000.00 to $60,010.00:

```
Change Percentage = |($60,010.00 - $60,000.00) / $60,000.00| × 100 = 0.0167%
```

Since 0.0167% < 0.1%, this would not trigger an update based on significant change alone.

## 4. GoMarket Data Processing

### 4.1 How Raw Data is Received

Raw data is received from GoMarket through two mechanisms:

1. **REST API Polling**: Periodic HTTP requests to fetch market data
2. **WebSocket Streaming**: Real-time data streams for immediate updates

**REST API Format**:
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
  "bid_price": 60000.50,
  "ask_price": 60001.00,
  "bid_size": 1.5,
  "ask_size": 2.0,
  "timestamp": 1700000000.123
}
```

### 4.2 How Data is Normalized

Data normalization ensures consistency across exchanges:

1. **Price Formatting**: Convert all prices to standard decimal format
2. **Size Formatting**: Convert all sizes to standard decimal format
3. **Timestamp Standardization**: Ensure all timestamps are in Unix format
4. **Symbol Standardization**: Validate and standardize symbol formats

### 4.3 How Data is Validated

Data validation includes several checks:

1. **Required Fields**: Verify presence of bid_price, ask_price, bid_size, ask_size, timestamp
2. **Data Types**: Ensure numeric values are valid floats
3. **Price Validation**: Check that prices are positive and reasonable
4. **Size Validation**: Check that sizes are non-negative
5. **Timestamp Validation**: Verify timestamp is recent (not stale)

**Validation Algorithm**:
```
IF bid_price ≤ 0 OR ask_price ≤ 0:
    REJECT data (invalid prices)
    
IF bid_size < 0 OR ask_size < 0:
    REJECT data (invalid sizes)
    
IF timestamp < (current_time - MAX_AGE):
    REJECT data (stale data)
    
IF NOT isinstance(bid_price, (int, float)):
    REJECT data (invalid type)
```

### 4.4 How Stale Data is Handled

Stale data handling mechanisms:

1. **Age Checking**: Compare data timestamp with current time
2. **Maximum Age Threshold**: Default 30 seconds for stale data detection
3. **Exclusion from Calculations**: Stale data is excluded from arbitrage and CBBO calculations
4. **Warning Logging**: Log warnings when stale data is detected
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Attempt to fetch fresh data when stale data is encountered

## 5. Edge Cases

### 5.1 How to Handle Missing Data from an Exchange

When data is missing from an exchange:

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing with available data from other exchanges
2. **Warning Logging**: Log warning about missing data
3. **Exclusion**: Exclude the exchange from calculations for that symbol
4. **Retry Logic**: Attempt to re-fetch data after a short delay
5. **User Notification**: Inform user about data availability issues

**Algorithm**:
```
FOR each exchange in target_exchanges:
    TRY:
        data = fetch_market_data(exchange, symbol)
        IF data is valid:
            add_to_valid_data(exchange, data)
        ELSE:
            log_warning("Invalid data from " + exchange)
    EXCEPT ConnectionError:
        log_warning("Connection failed to " + exchange)
        continue  // Skip this exchange
```

### 5.2 How to Handle Stale Prices

Stale price handling:

1. **Timestamp Validation**: Check data freshness using timestamp
2. **Maximum Age Limit**: Default 30-second threshold for stale data
3. **Exclusion**: Exclude stale data from arbitrage calculations
4. **Warning Messages**: Log warnings about stale data
5. **Fallback**: Use cached recent data if available

**Staleness Check**:
```
CURRENT_TIME = get_current_timestamp()
DATA_AGE = CURRENT_TIME - data_timestamp

IF DATA_AGE > MAX_STALENESS_THRESHOLD:
    MARK data as stale
    EXCLUDE from calculations
    LOG warning about stale data
```

### 5.3 How to Handle Exchange Outages

Exchange outage handling:

1. **Connection Error Detection**: Identify connection failures and timeouts
2. **Retry Mechanism**: Implement exponential backoff retry logic
3. **Temporary Exclusion**: Temporarily exclude failed exchanges from monitoring
4. **Status Monitoring**: Continuously monitor exchange status
5. **Recovery**: Automatically resume monitoring when exchange becomes available

**Outage Handling Algorithm**:
```
TRY:
    connect_to_exchange(exchange)
EXCEPT ConnectionError:
    increment_failure_count(exchange)
    IF failure_count[exchange] > MAX_FAILURES:
        temporarily_exclude_exchange(exchange)
        schedule_retry(exchange, exponential_backoff_time)
    ELSE:
        schedule_immediate_retry(exchange)
```

### 5.4 How to Handle Invalid Symbols

Invalid symbol handling:

1. **Symbol Validation**: Validate symbol format using regex patterns
2. **Exchange Verification**: Verify symbol exists on specified exchange
3. **Error Messages**: Provide clear error messages for invalid symbols
4. **Graceful Rejection**: Skip invalid symbols without affecting other operations

**Symbol Validation**:
```
VALID_SYMBOL_PATTERN = r'^[A-Za-z0-9\-_]+$'

FUNCTION validate_symbol(symbol):
    IF NOT regex_match(symbol, VALID_SYMBOL_PATTERN):
        RAISE InvalidSymbolError("Invalid symbol format: " + symbol)
    
    IF symbol NOT IN exchange_available_symbols:
        RAISE InvalidSymbolError("Symbol not available on exchange: " + symbol)
```

## 6. Performance Considerations

### 6.1 Caching Strategy

1. **Market Data Caching**: Cache recent market data to reduce API calls
2. **CBBO Caching**: Cache consolidated views for quick access
3. **Configuration Caching**: Cache user configurations in memory
4. **TTL Management**: Implement time-to-live for cached data

### 6.2 Computational Efficiency

1. **Optimized Comparisons**: Minimize redundant calculations
2. **Early Exit Conditions**: Exit loops early when conditions are met
3. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple symbols efficiently
4. **Memory Management**: Efficiently manage data structures

### 6.3 Network Optimization

1. **Connection Reuse**: Reuse HTTP connections for REST API calls
2. **WebSocket Multiplexing**: Use single WebSocket connections for multiple symbols
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits to avoid throttling
4. **Error Recovery**: Quickly recover from network errors
